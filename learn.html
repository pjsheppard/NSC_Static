						<p>We plan to hold Introduction to Sailing Courses during the 
						weekends of</p>
						<h3>April 21st/22nd; May 5th/6th; Jun 9th/10th</h3>
						<p>giving, weather-permitting, two full days sailing (approx 0900 to 1730)</p>
					</div>
					
					<img src="./images/IMG_5372cs.png" alt="training">

					<p>These courses are open to Members and non-Members.  The majority of
					 the weekend is spent on the water, by the end you should be able to 
					 helm a boat.  The Course runs alongside normal Club activities, 
					 providing an insight into racing and the Club as a whole. Book early
					  as places are limited.<br> 
					  <br>No previous experience is needed, the courses
					   being designed for absolute beginners.  The Club will provide your 
					   Instructor, boat, personal buoyancy aid, lunch and refreshments, although you
					    may use your own boat and/or buoyancy aid by arrangement.  You should
					     not book for the course unless you are physically fit for this 
					     sport.<br>
						<br>The cost for the weekend is £125 (Members £100).  Those who are
						 not already Members will be elected to Temporary Membership of
						  the Club for the month following the Course; this allows the 
						  same use of the Club and its facilities as all other Members,
						   but the Club will not be organising any further formal
						    Instruction after the Sunday.  Course Members will also benefit
						     from a reduced Joining Fee should they join the Club in the
						      ensuing few months.  Courses will be restricted to a 
						      maximum of 12 places, which will be allocated in order 
						      of receipt of Application Forms accompanied by payment
						       in full.</p>
